The Activity Recognition package is supposed to implement activity transition recognition.
However, as of right now, the activity recognition is not fully functional (it receives all 
transitions but can not read it from the Intent, since it lacks permission). 
*So this package is still work in progress* and is (temporarily) replaced by the 
DefaultTrackingAlgorithm.
