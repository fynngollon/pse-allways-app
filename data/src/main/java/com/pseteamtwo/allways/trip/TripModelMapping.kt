/**
 * Data model mapping extension functions. There are three model types:
 *
 * - Trip: External model exposed to other layers in the architecture.
 * Obtained using `toExternal`.
 *
 * - NetworkTrip: Internal model used to represent a trip from the network.
 * Obtained using `toNetwork`.
 *
 * - LocalTrip: Internal model used to represent a trip stored locally in a database.
 * Obtained using `toLocal`.
 *
 *
 * Note: JvmName is used to provide a unique name for each extension function with the same name.
 * Without this, type erasure will cause compiler errors because these methods will have the same
 * signature on the JVM.

//TODO("not sure if JvmName really is necessary")
