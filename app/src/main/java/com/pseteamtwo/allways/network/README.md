## network Package:
    Contains classes related to networking, such as ApiService for defining API endpoints and ApiClient for handling network requests.

## Additional Notes:
    We'll need to define the structure of the API requests and responses in ApiService.kt.
    Implement proper error handling and authentication mechanisms in your networking code.
    We should consider using background tasks (e.g., AsyncTask, Kotlin Coroutines) to perform network operations asynchronously and avoid blocking the main thread.
